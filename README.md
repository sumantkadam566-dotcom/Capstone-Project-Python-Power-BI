BANK CHURN ANALYSIS

🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis
Power BI Dashboards | Python Exploratory Data Analysis

📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the banking industry.
This project analyzes bank customer data to understand churn behavior, identify high-risk segments, and uncover key factors influencing customer attrition using Power BI and Python.
The project combines visual storytelling (Power BI) with deep exploratory analysis (Python) to deliver actionable business insights.

🎯 Objectives

Measure overall customer churn and key churn drivers
Analyze churn across geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, and product usage
Build interactive Power BI dashboards for business stakeholders
Perform Python-based EDA to validate patterns and relationships
Translate data findings into clear business insights

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI
Interactive dashboards
KPI cards
Slicers & filters
Customer persona analysis
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains bank customer information such as:
Demographics: Age, Gender, Geography
Financial details: Balance, CreditScore, EstimatedSalary
Behavioral data: Tenure, NumOfProducts, IsActiveMember

Target variable:
Exited → Customer Churn (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

📊 Power BI Dashboard Insights

✔ Overall churn rate KPI
✔ Churn analysis by:

Geography (France, Germany, Spain)
Gender
Age groups
Tenure
Number of products
Active vs inactive members

✔ High-balance churn analysis
✔ Customer persona dashboards (Churned vs Retained)
✔ Executive-friendly layout with slicers for interactive exploration

🐍 Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analysis performed using Python:
Missing value checks and handling
Dataset shape and class distribution
Churned vs non-churned customer comparison
Salary, balance, and credit score distributions
Correlation analysis among numeric features
Heatmaps to identify churn-related patterns
Outlier detection for churn-heavy segments
Age-based customer segmentation and churn comparison

🔍 Key Insights

Inactive members show significantly higher churn
Customers with only one product are more likely to churn
Certain age groups and geographies are high-risk
High-balance churned customers represent major revenue loss
Clear correlations exist between tenure, activity level, and churn

🚀 Business Impact

This analysis enables banks to:
Detect early churn signals
Focus retention strategies on high-risk segments
Improve customer lifetime value
Support data-driven decision-making through dashboards
